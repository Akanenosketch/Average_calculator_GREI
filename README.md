# Average_calculator_GREI
 All the GREI's subjects with their own avegare calculator
 
 **Note:** GREI is related to the Computer Science degree at UVigo, other universities might call it differently and most likely the subjects will be different and will evaluate on a different way.

## Why making this?

This is basically a website made for and by students and in this way students inside UVigo can calculate their average on the subject they need with only putting the needed input (to put it simple, to avoid doing unnecesary math because there's already enough maths during the degree).

## How does it work?

This has been made to work both standalone and as a part of ESEIbot's average command.

The only thing that the user needs to do is:
- Indicate wether they are a presential student or not (non-presential might also refer to July/end of degree exams).
- Input the marks they have on it's respective areas (the marks are regulated from 0 to 10).
- Click the "Calculate final mark" button. ~~Was it that hard? No, right?~~

If you are going thought the website, make sure you go to the right subject. On the other hand, if you used the bot to access there's nothing more to do other than the mentioned steps.

## What should I do if I find an error or if the evaluation system is different/confusing?

If the user finds an error or thinks that the calculator is different from the evaluation method that the teacher has mentioned it is recommended to do one of the two following things:
- Open an issue in the repository explaining the issue and how it should be solver or how it should be approached.
- If the user doesn't use GitHub it can message the dev in charge of this project.
